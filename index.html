            <h3>ODI Career</h3>
            <p id="odi-career"class="center" >AB de Villiers made his One Day International (ODI) debut against England in Bloemfontein
                on February 5, 2005.
                In his first match, he scored just 20 runs as the match ended in a tie. In 228 ODI matches, he scored
                9,577 runs at an average of
                53.5 and strike rate of 101.1. In 2015, the flamboyant right-hander scored the fastest century in ODIs
                in just 31 balls, and
                finished his innings at the score of 149 off 44 balls, against Windies. The 44-ball 149 included 9 fours
                and 16 sixes --
                it took him only 44 balls to equal Rohit Sharma's record tally of 16 sixes in an ODIs. AB de Villiers
                also holds the records for
                the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) in ODIs. He is a three-time ICC ODI player
                of the year, having won
                the titles in 2010, 2014 and 2015. He is also the only batsman in ODI cricket to have completed a trio
                of 5,000-plus runs, 50-plus
                average, and over 100 strike rate in career.

            <h3>T-20 Career</h3>
            <p id="t-20career"class="center" >
                AB de Villiers played his first T20 International match against Australia at The Wanderers Stadium in
                Johannesburg on February 24, 2006.
                He scored 1,672 runs in 78 matches at an average of 26.12 and a strike rate of 131.17. He holds the
                record for scoring the fastest
                fifty by a South African in T20Is.

            <h3>Test Career</h3>
            <img id="testimg" src="pic/test.webp">
            <p id="test-career"class="center" >
                AB de Villiers made his Test debut against England at Saint George’s park in Port Elizabeth on December
                17, 2004. He accumulated
                over 8,000 runs in Tests, with 22 centuries and 46 fifties and an average of 50.66. He holds the record
                for most Test innings
                without getting dismissed for a duck (78). He was finally dismissed without scoring against Bangladesh
                in November 2008. He also
                holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman (278 not out). In 2012-13, during
                the Australia tour, he
                curbed his natural instinct to score a 220-ball 33 in Adelaide to save the Test for his side.

            <h1>Retirement</h1>
            <img id="lasttweet" src="pic/retire.jpg">
            <p class="center" >
                Former South Africa captain AB de Villiers took to social media to announce his retirement from all
                forms of the game.

                AB de Villiers made the announcement on Friday, 19 November, marking an end to an incredible career that
                spanned more than 18 years.
                "It has been an incredible journey, but I have decided to retire from all cricket," ABD wrote on
                Twitter. "Ever since the back yard matches with my older brothers, I have played the game with pure
                enjoyment and unbridled enthusiasm. Now, at the age of 37, that flame no longer burns so brightly.

                "That’s the reality I must accept - and, even if it may seem sudden, that is why I am making this
                announcement today. I’ve had my time. Cricket has been exceptionally kind to me."

                Having made his international debut in 2004, AB de Villiers represented South Africa in 114 Tests, 228
                ODIs and 78 T20Is. Across formats, he amassed 20014 runs, averaging more than 50 in both Tests and ODIs.
                He retired from international cricket in May 2018.

                Under the leadership of de Villiers, South Africa made it to the semi-finals of the ICC Cricket World
                Cup 2015 in Australia but lost in a thriller to New Zealand.

                Amongst the several personal accolades achieved throughout his illustrious career, de Villiers holds the
                joint record for the most ICC Men's ODI Player of the Year awards won. He won it thrice - in years 2010,
                2014, 2015 - and is now tied with Virat Kohli.

                In the ICC Awards of the Decade last year, he was nominated for Sir Garfield Sobers Award for Male
                Cricketer of the Decade as well as the Men's ODI Cricketer of the Decade.

            <p class="center" > If de Villiers’ sudden retirement from international cricket in 2018 was hard to digest for the cricket
                fans, then the news of
                him not playing has made them lost in the woods.With 5162 runs from 184 IPL matches, De Villiers stands
                sixth on the all-time IPL
                scorers list and has the second-most runs for his franchise after his close aide Virat Kohli.

                <strong>“I have had a long and fruitful time playing for RCB. Eleven years have just whizzed by and
                    leaving the boys is extremely
                    bittersweet. Of course, arriving at this decision took a lot of time, but after a lot of
                    contemplation, I’ve decided to hang
                    up my boots and spend quality time with my family,” the South African said in a statement.</strong>

            <p class="center" >
                It’s not just the Indian fans who love AB de Villiers, but the player too gives his best to stay up to
                their expectations.
                In his farewell statement, he did mention his support for IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore and
                also called himself
                ‘Half-Indian’.

                <strong>“To all the people in Bangalore, all the people around the world who followed me and supported
                    me with the RCB team and any other team
                    that I represented over the years, thank you very much for that. I know I am not going anywhere, I’m
                    going to be an RCBian for life,”
                    he mentioned.</strong>
